Welcome to my blog!  

## A Fresh Start  

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet. I decided that 2025 would be the year I finally commit to writing more, and this blog is where I’ll share my thoughts, ideas, and reflections as I go.  

There is no set theme yet. I am letting myself write freely, and over time I imagine a pattern will emerge.  

## About Me  

I am a 26 year old software engineer based in Denver, Colorado. My focus is frontend development, but I am also exploring AI and large language models to see how they can improve my workflow and open new possibilities for building. At the same time I am sharpening my UI and UX skills, because so much of my work overlaps with design. I love making complex technology feel simple and accessible through thoughtful, human centered interfaces.  

A lot of this stems from how I grew up. As the “tech person” in my family, I was the one setting up websites, resetting passwords, and explaining how to use apps. That experience taught me that technology is only as powerful as it is usable, and I carry that lesson into my work today.  

## Beyond Work  

Life outside of coding is full too.  

During the week I spend most evenings dancing salsa and bachata at local clubs. I also teach salsa on Tuesdays, which has become one of the most rewarding parts of my routine. Dancing is my way to stay active, connect with people, and lose myself in music.  

On weekends I usually head outdoors. Hiking is one of my passions, and one of my long term goals is to climb all of Colorado’s 14ers. I love the challenge of long trails, jumping into alpine lakes, and the way conversations flow when you are hours into a hike with friends. Nature is my reset button.  

Right now I am reading *Rewrite Your Rules* by Morgan DeBaun.  
My current favorite song is *Mentiras* by Dani J and Kewin Cosmos.  

## Closing Thoughts  

I am glad I finally sat down to write this first post. It feels good to start, even imperfectly. Here is to writing more often, documenting the journey, and keeping my New Year’s resolution alive.  

XOXO,
