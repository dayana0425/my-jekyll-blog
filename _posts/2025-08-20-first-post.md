**Hello stranger**, welcome to my blog! I'm going to be using this blog to post my thoughts, ideas and brain barf lol. 

At the beginning of 2025, I made a new years resolution to write more and therefore, I thought the best way to do it was to start a blog where I could just write whatever I wanted.

I don't have a particular focus for this blog. It'll be random until it's not. :D

**A quick introduction:** I'm currently a 26 year old woman living in Denver, Colorado. I'm a software engineer by trade and during the weekdays you can find me dancing salsa/bachata at the clubs until late at night. During the weekends, I love being in nature. It's a life goal of mine to hike all the named 14ers in Colorado. I enjoy jumping into alpine lakes and visiting Rocky Mountain National Park for scenic hikes. I don't always hike to conquer but simply to enjoy and be in nature with no goal in mind. 

Anyways, I'm glad I made my first post. Here's to more posts and accomplishing my new years resolutions. Woo! FYI: I won't be using chatgpt or any AI assistance to write these posts. The goal is for *me* to write more. 

XOXO,
Day
