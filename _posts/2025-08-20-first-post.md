**Hello stranger** - Welcome to my blog! I’ll be using this space to share my thoughts, ideas, and all the things~

At the start of 2025, I made a New Year’s resolution to write more, and I figured the best way to stick to it was to start a blog where I can freely write about whatever I want.

There isn’t a specific theme here. It will be random until it’s not. :D

**A quick introduction** - Currently I’m a 26-year-old woman based in Denver, Colorado, working as a software engineer with a focus on frontend development. 

I’m currently exploring AI and large language models (LLMs) to better understand their use cases and improve my development workflow. At the same time, I’m leveling up my UI/UX skills, as my work often overlaps with design. I love creating intuitive user flows and interfaces that make complex technologies feel simple and accessible. I believe tech is incredibly powerful, and it’s deeply rewarding to reduce friction & barriers of *access* through thoughtful, human-centered design.

**Outside of working hours** - I like to do a lot.

<u>During the week</u>, you’ll usually find me dancing salsa and bachata at local clubs late into the night (& I also teach Salsa). It’s my favorite way to stay active, have fun, and connect with others through music.

<u>On weekends</u>, I love being out in nature. One of my goals is to hike all of Colorado’s named 14ers. I enjoy jumping into alpine lakes, visiting Rocky Mountain National Park, and simply being present in the beauty of nature.

**Anyway** - I’m glad I finally made my first post. Here’s to more writing and making progress on my New Year’s resolutions. **Woo!**

XOXO,
