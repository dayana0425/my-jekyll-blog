Read about my decision to stop running from my problems.

## What Is Going On?

Basically, I realized I have problems. I keep telling myself this lie that everything is fine and perfect—but in reality, it’s not. Since I keep saying everything is fine, I don’t take any actions to fix my problems (because “there are no problems”… but there are).  

For the past 4 months, I’ve been living in denial and avoiding confronting ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.  

I can’t be too specific, but I can give an example. Let’s say I run out of toothpaste. I need toothpaste for good oral health. Without it, I risk cavities or disease that could lead to something serious. The solution? Buy more toothpaste.  

But instead of fixing the problem… I pretend I didn’t run out. I distract myself. Days go by, my teeth get nastier, and nothing “bad” happens yet—but eventually it will. That’s avoidance.  

And that’s basically how I’ve been with a lot of things. Not just one or two—probably five different things I’ve been running away from.  

So if you ask me “How have you been?” THIS is how I’ve been. Now, to be clear: this is only a metaphor. I do brush my teeth twice a day and take care of my oral health. But this is exactly how I’ve been treating other parts of my life.  

I am not fine, but I am not terrible either.  

## What Now?

IDK… I guess I will confront my problems one by one. I’ll stop running away.  

If I encounter a “problem,” I want to address it instead of letting it build up inside me. For at least 30 minutes a day, I want to sit with the discomfort of confronting my problems and actually acknowledging them.  

## Conclusion

I am probably being overly dramatic right now so don't think this is my rock bottom. I am just not happy with myself. I am just a human who wants to be better. I am currently having a hard time but I am also... grateful for A LOT of things. Super grateful. 

If you're reading this, do not worry! I'm OK.

XOXO, 
Day
