A personal story about rebuilding my identity through movement, community, and creativity after feeling stuck post-grad.

## My Burnout Arc 

Ever since graduating college (December 2021), hobbies have been such a BIG topic in my life. 

In college, I was a productivity junkie. I had a pretty toxic mindset around “having fun” or doing things that didn’t directly get me closer to my goals. Back then, my only goal was to graduate with my Computer Science degree and land a $150k/year job.

And I did everything to achieve it. I didn’t care about my social life. I barely had one friend. I never exercised, never left campus - I just studied, worked, and repeated the cycle. Until one day, I realized: **I wasn’t living anymore.**

After graduation, I got the job I had prayed for. But that job made me feel depressed, isolated, and uninspired. I’d sit in my pajamas every day, and weekends felt like a black hole. I’d spend the whole day in bed. I started resenting people who had friends, plans, or hobbies. The truth is… I never built an identity outside of my grind which I think has to do with a lot of reasons like growing up low-income, being first-gen, and always being in survival mode.

So, one day (after talking with my therapist) I made it my mission to find hobbies. Not side hustles. Not networking events. Actual hobbies — things I do for fun, just because I want to. 

Things that make me feel alive and bring balance to my life. I love coding (#codingisfun), but I was suffering from building my whole personality around work.

## The 3 Hobby Rule 

There’s this concept in psychology called the **3 Hobby Rule**:

You need:

* One hobby that requires deep focus (like chess or sewing),
* One that involves movement (like hiking or exercise classes),
* And one for social connection (like dancing or volunteering).

The idea is that high-functioning, mentally well people tend to have a balance between these three areas. And honestly? I believe it. Because once I started pursuing all three, things finally started to shift.

It wasn’t easy. I spent 1–2 years trying new hobbies, and nothing would stick. I’d get excited, then drop them. I felt frustrated, like I was failing at “fun.” But now? I’ve found the ones I love. The ones that actually make me excited to wake up in the morning.

I think after college, finding hobbies is crucial because you need to discover who you are outside of being a student. 

So, back to this 3 Hobby Rule or whatever.

It honestly changed my life.

Psychologists say the reason you feel scattered, stuck, or exhausted might not be because you’re lazy—it might be because you’re unbalanced.

“Balance” is a magical word. And after experiencing hardcore burnout, I’ve realized: **BALANCE IS EVERYTHING !!!!**

So what are my 3 hobbies? Let’s get into them…

## Hobby #1: My Movement Hobby

My hobby journey started with being a fitness queen — right after COVID ended and I was working fully remote. I had gained 50 pounds since the start of the pandemic, and I wasn’t moving much day to day. Naturally, I hit a point where I said, “I need to change. I want to change.”

So I signed up for Orangetheory, and that’s what made me fall in love with fitness—especially fitness classes. I started going regularly, and it felt amazing… until the workouts started feeling repetitive. So I started exploring: I tried YogaSix, CycleBar, and barre.

Right now, I’m back at Orangetheory, and I still do CycleBar. They’re both high-energy, and they help me clear mental fatigue like nothing else. As a coder, I’m using my brain all day. These workouts let me release that fatigue through movement.

But I’ve also realized I need balance—because when I’m overstimulated, high-intensity workouts can actually make me feel worse. I remember one month when I had so much going on that I was in constant overdrive. I couldn’t even bring myself to go to Orangetheory. And that was a red flag: when you work out and don’t feel better afterwards, something’s off.

Now, I treat exercise like a tool.

* Sometimes I use it to burn off stress and feel unstoppable.
* Other times I use it to cool down, reconnect with myself, and reset my nervous system.

After a yoga session, I feel like the world is big and I am small—and somehow, that’s comforting.

After a HIIT session at Orangetheory, I feel powerful. Like, Damn, I’m not just a sedentary code monkey — I’m an ATHLETE.

Also, shoutout to cycle syncing. On my period, I’ve learned that doing low-intensity workouts like barre makes a huge difference. 

## Hobby #2: My Social Hobby

My second hobby, the one that fulfills my need for social connection, was something I didn’t even realize was missing—until I found salsa dancing in October 2024.

Before that, my life was solo-mode. I worked, I worked out, and then I worked some more. Everything I did was independent. And while I loved being productive, I wasn’t building relationships. Making friends after college was hard. I’d go to networking events hoping to meet like-minded people, but it always felt transactional. I constantly had to be the one to initiate plans. I wanted to be part of something where I could just show up—and be known.

That’s when I found the dance community.

I used to dance in high school—mainly K-pop choreography—but I hadn’t danced in over 5 years. Salsa pulled me back in. What amazed me was that you don’t even need to talk. You just connect through movement. You dance with everyone in the room. It’s present, it’s playful, it’s safe, and it helped me rebalance my entire social life.

Working remotely and sitting in your room all day can feel isolating. It’s not enough to have four friends you occasionally grab dinner with—you need a community. Salsa became mine.

I could talk about this forever (seriously), but I’ll leave it at this: it changed everything for me.

## Hobby #3: My Deep Focus Hobby

My third hobby—the one that requires deep focus—is something I honestly prioritize less. My job already demands a ton of concentration and mental energy, so when I do have free time, I usually gravitate toward movement or connection.

That said, I’ve tried deep focus hobbies.
I’ve sewn. I’ve crocheted. I’ve participated in hackathons. They were fun at times, but honestly? They left me feeling drained more than fulfilled. So for now, I don’t force this category. I’ve learned that balance doesn’t always mean checking every box every day. It means listening to what you actually need.

## Final Thoughts

This 3-hobby framework gave me language for something I didn’t even know I was missing: balance.

- Not productivity.
- Not optimization.
- Not achievement.

**Just balance.**

I’m still figuring it out. Some weeks I lean more into dance, other weeks I want solitude. And sometimes, I do drop the hobbies I swore I loved. That’s okay too. The point isn’t perfection—it’s presence.

If you’ve been feeling unmotivated, lost, or just stuck in a loop… maybe you’re not lazy.
Maybe you’re just unbalanced.

So I’ll leave you with this question:
